## Woo!
You made it! All of your hard work and long hours have lead you here... to this moment... a moment of glory! You've earned every gym badge, defeated every boss, wrestled with your inner daemons (heh) to ultimately lead you to this.

## <a id="expectations">What to expect from the Project Review</a>

Project reviews are focused on preparing you for [technical interviews](https://www.brightnetwork.co.uk/career-path-guides/technology-it-software-development/five-ways-stand-out-your-technology/what-expect-technical-interview/). Treat project reviews as if they were technical interviews in both attitude and technical presentation.

During your project review, be prepared to:

1. Explain your code from execution point to exit point. Use the best technical vocabulary you can. 15 minutes
2. Live code. This could be refactoring, adding a new feature, or both. 20 minutes
3. You will also be asked questions that test your knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals. 10 minutes

If any requirements are missing or if significant gaps in understanding are found, be prepared to do one or all of the following:

- Submit an improved version
- Meet again for another Project Review

What won't happen:

- You won't be yelled at, belittled, or scolded
- You won't be put on the spot without support
- There's nothing you can do to instantly fail or blow it

## <a id="requirements">Project Requirements</a>
This lesson covers your final assignment. It is supposed to be your magnum opus — a culmination of
all the skills you've learned so far. It's going to be a tough one, but you'll make it through. For this project you will be building a React frontend as well as Rails API, the requirements of which are as follow:

React Frontend:
1. The code should be written in ES6 as much as possible, do not use jQuery.
2. Use the `create-react-app` generator to start your project.
	- Follow the instructions on this repo to setup the generator: [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
3. Your app should have one HTML page to render your React-Redux application.
4. There should be at least two container components.
5. There should be at least five functional/presentional components.
6. There should be at least three routes.
7. Your React Frontend should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation.
8. Your app must make use of `react-router` and proper RESTful routing (should you choose to use react-router v3 please refer to the appropriate [docs](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v3/docs); docs for v4 can be found [here](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start))
9. Use the redux-thunk middleware to make asynchronous actions to respond to and send data to your Rails API server.
10. Your app should have some minimal styling: feel free to stick to a framework (like react-bootstrap), but if you want to write (additional) CSS yourself, go for it!

Rails API:
1. Your Rails API should handle data persistence through a database.
2. Your Rails API should be able to handle Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting at least one resource via AJAX requests from your React frontend (you can JS's Fetch API or an external library such as axios, but no jQuery).

Go wild! These are only the basic requirements — you're free to add on as much stuff as you'd like.

## <a id="support">Project Support</a>

Unlike the rest of the curriculum, if you have any questions about your assessment or need help with it, please don’t use the Ask A Question feature. Rather than working with AAQ technical coaches, please reach out to your Learn Instructor responsible for this section.

You can find your Learn Instructor using the following link: [Who are the section leads](http://help.learn.co/instructional-support/receiving-course-support/who-are-the-section-leads).

## <a id="frequent">F.A.Qs</a>
1. How do I connect a Rails API backend to a React Frontend?
- Todo: Add Link to video recording of study group
2. Can I use __?
- Todo: Add Link to Howard's repo on what can they use
3. Should I make everything in One repo or in two seperate repos?
- Todo: Add link to gist explaining the differences.  


## <a id="success">Practicing for Success on Learn</a>

#### Be scrappy.

- If you make a mistake, correct yourself! We all make mistakes, I promise.
- Think on your feet. Feel free to look things up while you're pairing with us. You'll be asked to expand on concepts you implemented and you will be pushed to the edge of your knowledge.
- Explain the details. We're curious!
- Don’t worry if your code isn’t perfect the first time - focus on getting something working, then refactoring to improve it.

#### Make no little plans.

- You're going to learn a ton. We will give pointers and show you ways to improve your code. This isn't telling you that your code is wrong, it's simply us teaching. Whatever you don't quite understand will be explained.
- Be proud of your project and your code, and show confidence in it.

#### Radiate positivity.

- Present yourself and your project in the best way possible.
- Be open to feedback, both positive and constructive.
- Remember, the interviewer is a person too. Be nice to them!

#### Work Together.

- Trust yourself.
- Trust us - our goal is to help you be successful in achieving your goals.
- We understand that this process can be stressful. We’re here to help you through.

#### Pursue mastery.

- Use the best technical vocabulary you can. We’ll help you with the words you can’t remember, or if you’re unsure about how something is pronounced.
- Ask questions! Curiosity and willingness to learn are hugely valued in our industry. If you haven’t heard of something, that’s okay - use this opportunity to learn about it!
